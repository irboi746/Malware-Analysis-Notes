# Introduction
* A suspected malicious file is referred to as a **sample** and not a malware as analysis has to be done first in order to determine if it is malicious or benign.
* The first thing to do with a sample is to conduct static analsis on it. Without proper static analysis, malware is not to be executed.
* As mentioned in the introduction, Static Analysis is divded into two different approaches : Basic and Advanced Static Analysis.

## [Basic Static Analysis](https://github.com/irboi746/Malware-Analysis-Notes/tree/main/Static_Analysis/Basic_Static_Analysis)
* refers to observing the file's metadata and other information that is embedded in it. 
* There are four phases in basic static analysis : 
   1. File Identification and Classification
   2. Scanning
   3. File Format Analysis
   4. Identifying Obfuscation 

## Advanced Static Analysis
* where the analyst examines the source code of the sample and it is usually at assembly code level.

## Indicator of Compromise (IOCs)
* IOCs are any forensic data that is found on a network or host that could with high confidence identify an intrusion.
* Below is a non-exhasutive list of common IOCs :

|Network-Based|Host-Based|
|-------------|----------|
|IP Addresses|File Names|
|URLs|File Hashes|
|Domain Names|File Locations (path on host)|
|Source Email Address|DLLs used|
|Email Message Objects|Registry Keys|
|Email Attachments|Process Handle or Mutex Name|
|X.509 Certificate Hashes| |
|X-Originating and X-Forwarding IP addresses| |

### Signature Based Detection and Malware Signatures
* With the use of static analysis, we will be able to identify IOCs and one or many IOCs form a signature, that can be used in Signature-based detection.
* The best signature are those with high granularity as signatures that is overly generic can lead to a lower chance of detection and multiple false positive.

### Detection Mechanism
* A **detection mechanism** can be any tool that range from searching for a specifc file hash (signature-based) or a tool searching for specific statistics and pattern (anomaly-based). 
* There are 4 main types of detection mechanism : 
   1. Signature-based
   2. Anomaly-based
   3. Reputation-based
   4. Hybrid   

* Common sense rule for better detection : **the higher the quality of data fed into the detection mechanism, the better the results.** 

## YARA Rules
* YARA rules are a way of identifying malware (or other files) by creating rules that look for certain characteristics like strings and boolean expressions.
