# Introduction
* A suspected malicious file is referred to as a **sample** and not a malware as analysis has to be done first in order to determine if it is malicious or benign.
* The first thing to do with a sample is to conduct static analsis on it. Without proper static analysis, malware is not to be executed.
* As mentioned in the introduction, Static Analysis is divded into two different approaches : Basic and Advanced Static Analysis.

## [Basic Static Analysis](https://github.com/irboi746/Malware-Analysis-Notes/tree/main/Static_Analysis/Basic_Static_Analysis)
* refers to observing the file's metadata and other information that is embedded in it. 
* There are four phases in basic static analysis : 
   1. File Identification and Classification
   2. Scanning
   3. File Format Analysis
   4. Identifying Obfuscation 

## Advanced Static Analysis
* where the analyst examines the source code of the sample and it is usually at assembly code level.
