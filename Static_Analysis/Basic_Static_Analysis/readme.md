# File Identification and Classification
* the process of identifying the file type and obtaining a unique 'signature' 
* file identification will help build basic detection methods and Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
* will help decide which tools to use during analysis

## Steps in File Identification
### 1. Identify File Type 
* Two types of file in a computer system : 
   1. ASCII (Plain Text) Files : can be read with any text editor like HTML, MD, XML, TXT etc.
   2. Structured (Binary) Files : where the file has its owm structure to represent its content, like PDF, EXE etc.
* Usually, file type can be identified based on their icon and extension, but it is not uncommon to find malicious files masquerading as another file type like EXE file stored with JPG extension.
* Hence we will need to use tools such as Hex editor to comparing the header manually or using tools like ***file*** command in linux to verify the file type.

### 2. Classify with File Hash 
* after determining the file type, we will need to determine if the sample is an already known malware like it belongs to a certain malware family, or even an APT group.
* therefore hashes, a unique fixed size string generated from passing the bianries into the hashing algorithm is a way to fingerprint the file and used as an IOC. 
* This signature/fingerprint can then be searched for its existence on databases such as VirusTotal and if hashes match, we will already have knowledge base on how to handle the sample.  
* Hashing used : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, FuzzyHash, ImpHash
* Tools used : certutil, md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, HashMyFiles(nirsoft), Hasher(Zimmerman)

#### Hashes vs Polymorphism
* 1 bit change in the file will change the hash of the file significantly, and this is an issue with polymorphic malware (malware that can modify themselves).
* There are three methods that can be used to deal with polymorphic malware and they are : 
   1. Fuzzy Hashing    
      * works by segmenting the file and then hashing the segmented file. Afterwhich a mathematical function is run over it to generate a value. 
      * This value generated is then compared to other files within a database and we are provided with the statistics of how similar the sample is to the ones seen in the database.
   2. Import Hash (ImpHash)
   3. Section Hash

### 3. Strings   
* a sequence of ASCII or Unicode characters represented in hexadecimal. 
* Most strings are implemented using arrays and usually terminated with null.
* There are two types of strings namely printable and non-printable and common non-printable strings are like "\n" and "\r" which in hex is "\x0a" and "\x0d" respectively.
* Non-exhaustive list of information obtained with strings :

|IP Addresses / Domain Names|Error handling Messages|Other Names, Keywords|

# Scanners & Sandboxes
* A scanner is a software with the capability of scanning a file and deciding whether it is benign or malicious for e.g antivirus software.
* A sandbox is a software that uses a security mechanism of creating an isolated or controlled environment and allows a program to run inside it for e.g virtual machines.

## Scanner
* Scanners can be running on host computer, network or on a remote server hosted by a separate vendor as such there are two types of scanners namely online and offline. 
* Offline Scanners : ClamAV, Malwarebytes, AV softwares etc.
   * It is the responsibility of the user to update the signature database of the offline scanner.
* Online Scanners : Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis. 
   * Caution : Not to upload samples to online scanners in the middle of an investigation or a secret investigation. Malware authors have access to these online scanner databases and you run the risk of malware authors finding out and destroying the malware before any meaningful investigation can be done.
