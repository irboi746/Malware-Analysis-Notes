# File Identification and Classification
* the process of identifying the file type and obtaining a unique 'signature' 
* file identification will help build basic detection methods and Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
* will help decide which tools to use during analysis
* Steps in File Identification
   1. Identify File Type : 
      * Two types of file in a computer system : 
         1. ASCII (Plain Text) Files : can be read with any text editor like HTML, MD, XML, TXT etc.
         2. Structured (Binary) Files : where the file has its owm structure to represent its content, like PDF, EXE etc.
      * Most of the time, file type can be identified based on their icon and extension, but it is also not uncommon to find malicious files masquerading as another file type like EXE file stored with JPG extension.
      * Hence we will need to use tools such as Hex editor to comparing the header manually or using tools like ***file*** command in linux to verify the file type.

   2. Classification with File Hash : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, FuzzyHash, ImpHash
      * after determining the file type, we will need to determine if the sample is an already known malware like it belongs to a certain malware family, or even an APT group.
   
   3. Strings
