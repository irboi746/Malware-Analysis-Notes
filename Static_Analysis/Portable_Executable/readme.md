## Shared Libraries
* Executables nowadays depend on other executables or libraries.
* A library is a collection of code that can be used by multiple programs at the same time.
* In Microsoft Executables, the library will use the *.dll* file extension but will have headers that are similar to *.exe* files.

## Static vs Dynamic Linking
* Linker is responsible for adding the libraries into the final executable.
* There are 2 types of linkers : 
   1. With static linking, the linker will resolve all library requirements and copy the library into the final executable, thus producing an executable with the library embedded inside.
   2. Dynamic Linking is sub divided into two more types : 
      * Implicit Linking
      * Explicit Linking
