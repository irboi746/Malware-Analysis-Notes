# Dynamic Analysis
* Dynamic Malware Analysis is the analysis of malware samples by running them in a contained environment.
* A contained environment can be anything from a virtual machine to a physical system that is running on an air-gapped network or an automated sandbox.
* In dynamic analysis, it is important we provide the malware sample with the correct environment it needs to execute.

## Security States
* Refers to the security level of the environment used to analyse the malware.
* In general there are 2 different types of security state used to analyse malware : 
1. Insecure Environment
   * an environment created to be intentionally vulnerable to see the full extent of capabilities of malware.
2. Hardened Environment
   * To test the ability of the environment in withstanding a successful compromise, where environment is created to be secure and malware is executed in it to find hidden, exploitable misconfigurations that the malware might be looking for.  

## Tooling
### Restoring Tools
* Shadow Defender
* DeepFreeze
* Rollback Rx Professional

### Sandbox
* [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie/sandboxie)
* Cuckoo

## Methodology
* There are 4 phases in dynamic analysis : Baseline, Pre-Execution, Post-Execution, Analyse and Document. 
### Phase 1 : Baseline
* Creating a VM with OS required
* Installing the required tools and softwares
* Take a snapshot of the VM

### Phase 2 : Pre-Execution
* Perform any specific configuration needed
* Transfer malware sample onto machine
* Start required tools (monitoring, tracking, debugging, prerequisites)
   
### Phase 3 : Post-Execution
* Execute the malware
* Start tracking and monitoring its behavior and activities
* Dump / capture artefacts.
   
### Phase 4 : Analyze and Document
* Analyse and take notes of activities
* Observe exhibited behaviour
* Document events and actions
