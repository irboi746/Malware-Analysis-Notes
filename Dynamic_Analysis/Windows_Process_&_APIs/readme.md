# Windows Processes
* A process is a resource mechanism used to represent a running instance of a program.
* 
# Windows API
* WinAPIs are sets of functions and data structures that demands the Windows OS to perform some functionalities.
* Windows programs usually rely on these API functions to work.

## Process Injection Techniques
* Process injection is used by malware to evade detection.
* It involves executing custom code within another process address space to improve stealth and achieve persistence (think process migration in metasploit)
* Below is a list of common injection techniques : 
   1. Classical DLL Injection
   2. PE Injection
   3. Process Hollowing, Process Replacement or RunPE
   4. Thread Execution Hijacking
   5. Injection via Hooks (SetWindowsHookEx)
   6. Injection via Registry Modifications
   7. APC Injection
   8. Extra Window Memory Injection (EWMI)
   9. Early Bird API Injection
   10. API Hooking Techniques
       * Inline API Hooking
       * Inline API Hooking with Trampoline
       * IAT Hooking

## Common APIs used by Malware
* Keystroke Loggers
* Network Traffic Monitoring
* Downloaders
* HTTP C2 Traffic
* Dropper
* DLL Injection Function Calls
* Process Hollowing
* Anti-Debug/Anti-VM
