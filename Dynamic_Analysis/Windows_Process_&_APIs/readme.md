# Windows Processes
* A process is a resource mechanism used to represent a running instance of a program.

# Windows API
* WinAPIs are sets of functions and data structures that demands the Windows OS to perform some functionalities.
* Windows programs usually rely on these API functions to work.

## [Process Injection Techniques](https://github.com/irboi746/Malware-Analysis-Notes/tree/main/Dynamic_Analysis/Windows_Process_&_APIs/Process_Injection_Techniques)
* Process injection is used by malware to evade detection.
* It involves executing custom code within another process address space to improve stealth and achieve persistence (think process migration in metasploit)
* Below is a list of common injection techniques : 

| S/N | Technique Name                                  | S/N | Technique Name                                                                              |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | DLL Injection                                   | 6   | Injection via Registry Modifications                                                        |
| 2   | PE Injection                                    | 7   | APC Injection                                                                               |
| 3   | Process Hollowing, Process Replacement or RunPE | 8   | Extra Window Memory Injection (EWMI)                                                        |
| 4   | Thread Execution Hijacking                      | 9   | Early Bird API Injection                                                                    |
| 5   | Injection via Hooks (SetWindowsHookEx)          | 10  | API Hooking Techniques:  <br>* Inline API Hooking <br>* Inline API Hooking with Trampoline <br>* IAT Hooking |
