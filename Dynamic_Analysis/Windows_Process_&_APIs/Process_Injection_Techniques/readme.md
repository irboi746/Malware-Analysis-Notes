# DLL Injection
## Classical DLL Injection
* where malware writes the path of its DLL into the address space of a legitimate process and creates a remote thread in the targeted process to guarantee that the remote process will load the injected code.
* One way to achieve this is to use the `Import Adder` function in `CFF Explorer`
* Downside of this technique is that a malicious DLL has to be on disk, and thus not stealthy.

## Reflective DLL Injection

# PE Injection
* Malware copies its malicious code into an existing process and runs it using shellcode or by calling CreateRemoteThread.
* Advantange of this technqiue is that it does not require a malicious DLL on the disk.
