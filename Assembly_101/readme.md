# What is Assembly Language?
* A type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
* It is an intermediate layer between machine code and most high level lanuages
* Features : 
   1. Close to machine code : every machine code is represented by an assembly instruction 
   2. Non-portable : It is specific to the type of processor (CPU) used. 
   3. No abstraction : Language does not provide objects, classes, functions etc. Assembly instruction is converted to machine code depending on its operand.

Components in High level view of CPU: 
1. Control Unit (CU) : manages  execution and data flow of all other components
2. Registers : memory storage within the CPU for use by machine instructions.
3. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) : handles Arithmetic and Logical (bitwise) operations 
4. Floating Point Unit (FPU) : handle arithmetic operations with float values.

## AMD64 CPU
Registers
1. General Purpose Registers
   * 16 64-bit registers that stores values to be used as operands for logical and arithmetic operations, operands for memory address and pointer to memory locations.
 
2. Segment Registers
   * 6 64-bit registers used to control memory segmentation during execution.

3. RFLAGS Register
   * a 64-bit register that holds many bit-represented flags.

4. Instruction Pointer Register
   * a 64-bit register that points to the memory location that holds the next machine instruction to be executed.
