## Introduction
* Malware Analysis is the art of dissecting the malware (malicious Software) to answer three main questions : 
   1. How does it work?
   2. How can it be detected?
   3. How can the threat be eliminated ?
* It is an art as the techniques to analysis differs based on personality. As such, what is in this note is my interpretation of malware analysis.
* The end goal of MA is to identify the signature of the malware and detect similar or the same malware based on these signature which are also known as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
### Malware Analysis (MA) vs Reverse Engineering (RE)
   * MA and RE are two different skillset but RE is complementary to MA.
   * RE is the art of dissecting a product to understand its blueprint and it helps to answer the three mains questions MA set out to answer.
### Types of Malware
* Malware need not only be from one class, it be classified like below :  

|Type|Definition |Type|Definition|
|----|-----------|----|----------|
|Virus|malware that infects the target and requires user intervention to copy itself and spread to other computer or systems|Worm|Similar to virus, but just that it does not require human intervention to spread.|
|Scareware|malware that uses social engineering to trick user into buying or downloading unwanted software|Ransomware|Malware that lock's or encrypt's the victim's sensitive information/data and blackmailing the user for decryption|
|Botnet|A group of system infected with the same malware controlled by the attacker through a Command & Control (C2) server usually used for DDoS attack.|Trojan|Software that behaves like a regular program but has malicious code running within it.|
|Spyware|Malware that attacker use to eavesdrop, gather information or destroy the victim's machine|Rootkit|malware that evades detection by hiding in the system|
|Keylogger|malware that logs a user's keystroke|Logic Bomb|A code or portion of code that remains dormant for a period of time and triggered only when the time is right or with certain triggers|
|Backdoor/RAT|a malware that gives attacker remote access to the user's system|Information Stealer|malware whose main purpose is to steal infromation and exfiltrate it back|
|Downloader|malware that is paired with other malware, that helps to download and install the other malware|Dropper|Malware thar has another malware executable embedded within.|
|Adware|malware that gives user unwanted advertisements| | |

## Analysis Techniques
### Static
* Basic
* Advanced
### Dynanmic
* Basic
* Advanced

## MA Tools
* Tools change with time, but the nature of the tool remains the same. Hence it is more important to understand the nature of the tool than the tool in specific.
* Tools needed for MA are : 
   1. File Format Analyzers
   2. System and Monitoring Tools
   3. Debuggers and Disassemblers
   4. Other tools like data converters, decryptors, registry tools etc.
   5. Virtualisation Tools i.e VMs
   6. IDE to write custom script.
